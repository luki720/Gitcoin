🪙 Gitcoin

Since people buy anything that has a GitHub link nowadays, I decided to make Gitcoin.

🚀 What Is Gitcoin?

Gitcoin is the next-gen, AI-powered, military-grade, SpaceX-level technology for people who like clicking “⭐ Star” before reading a single line of code.

We don’t just build — we deploy random ChatGPT-generated code to look sophisticated, bullish, and slightly unhinged.

⚙️ Features

✅ Integrated military-level SpaceX tek

🤖 AI-generated randomness for extra “utility”

🧠 Optimized for bullishness, not usefulness

💾 Includes GitHub link, therefore 100× more legitimate

🐂 Backed by nothing — but with confidence

💻 Installation
git clone https://github.com/you/gitcoin
cd gitcoin
npm install


(Nothing actually installs, but it looks cool.)

🧬 How It Works

We asked ChatGPT to generate random pieces of code that:

compile (sometimes),

sound technical,

and contain at least three buzzwords per line.

Result: a repo that looks like it does something important.
